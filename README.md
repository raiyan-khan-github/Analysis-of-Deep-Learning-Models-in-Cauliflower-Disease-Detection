# Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Algorithms for Disease Detection in Cauliflower Images

This project is a comparative analysis of various deep learning algorithms, including ResNet50, VGG16, Inception V3, and a custom model. The aim is to detect diseases in cauliflower images. The entire project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) using Kaggle's notebook environment.

## Description

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of several deep learning algorithms on a specific dataset of cauliflower images. The algorithms we're comparing are:

- **ResNet50**: A 50 layer deep network used widely for image classification.
- **VGG16**: A 16 layer deep network known for its simplicity and performance.
- **Inception V3**: A network known for its complex structure and high accuracy.
- **Custom Model**: A model built from scratch tailored to our specific dataset.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have a Kaggle account. You can view and run the notebook directly on Kaggle.

## Usage

After logging into Kaggle, navigate to the notebook and click on the "Copy and Edit" button to create your own copy of the notebook. You can then run the cells in your own copy of the notebook.

## Results

The results of the comparative analysis will be displayed in the notebook itself.
